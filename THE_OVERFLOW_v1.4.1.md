## What is DYBL?

DYBL (Decentralised Yield Bearing Legacy) is a payment primitive featuring the Eternal Seed mechanism. A percentage of every payment is retained forever, creating a compounding pool that can only grow under normal conditions.

**Flagship demo:** Lettery. A lottery where all users buy tickets, earn yield, and the pot floor only rises.

**But Lettery isn't the product.**

**The Overflow is the product.**

   All funds earn yield via Aave
```

Seed never leaves. Pot floor only rises. Simple.

But what happens when the system matures?

---

## The Five Phases

### Phase 1: Early Growth (Years 1-5)

Treasury takes configured percentage from every ticket.

- Funds operations
- Funds giveaway reserve (cashback, rewards)
- Prize pot grows from remaining allocation
- Normal operation

**Target:** $1M → $10M → $50M TVL

---

### Phase 2: Treasury Sunset (Years 5-10)

Treasury reaches safe minimum. Ops costs are known and covered.

What changes:
- Treasury STOPS taking from frontend
- Prize/Seed pot INCREASES (e.g., 65% → 75%)
- Game ops funded by remaining ops reserve
- More value flows to users

**Target:** $50M → $100M TVL

---

### Phase 3: Jackpot Cap Hit (Years 5-10)

Jackpot reaches configured cap.

What happens:
- Excess can't go to jackpot (already at cap)
- Overflow begins
- Immutable splits activate

**Target:** Overflow fund begins accumulating

---

### Phase 4: Overflow Distribution (Years 10+)

Overflow splits to three destinations. Immutable. Can't be changed.

| Destination | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Savers** | Reward consistent users |
| **Treasury (Overflow)** | Fund expansion and operations |
| **Charity** | Decentralised charities with proof of impact |

---

### Phase 5: Expansion (Years 10-50+)

After overflow demonstrates stability and continuous growth, expansion begins.

**The Eternal Seed is infrastructure, not competition.**

We don't compete with financial institutions and governments. We provide a primitive they can build on.

## Working WITH Governments

### The Value Proposition for Governments

| Government Goal | How DYBL Helps |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Increase savings rates | Behavioural incentives proven to work |
| Financial inclusion | Low barrier entry, accessible yields |
| Reduce welfare dependency | Citizens build wealth automatically |
| Transparent public finance | On-chain, auditable, immutable |
| Pension sustainability | Encourage consistent contributions |

### How Governments Could Adopt

| Approach | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **License the Primitive** | Government licenses Eternal Seed for public savings programme | National "Seed Savings Bond" |
| **Regulatory Sandbox** | Trial in controlled environment | UK FCA sandbox, Singapore MAS |
| **Public-Private Partnership** | Government oversight, private operation | Like Premium Bonds but with DeFi yield |
| **Incentive Programme** | Tax benefits for Eternal Seed savers | ISA-style wrapper for DYBL products |

### The Regulatory Path

| Phase | Action | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| **1. Demonstrate** | Lettery runs successfully | Prove mechanics work |
| **2. Engage** | Proactive regulator discussions | Build understanding |
| **3. Sandbox** | Apply for sandbox inclusion | Test with guardrails |
| **4. License** | Formal licensing framework | Mainstream adoption |
| **5. Partner** | Government-endorsed products | Public sector scale |

**We don't circumvent regulation. We work within it.**

## Expansion Pot Types

New pots seeded from overflow, in partnership with institutions:

| Pot Type | Partner | Value Created |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Banking Pots** | Licensed banks | Novel savings products for their customers |
| **Government Pots** | Public sector bodies | Transparent, incentivised public savings |
| **Pension Pots** | Pension providers | Behavioural nudges increase contributions |
| **Utility Pots** | Utility companies | Bill payment rewards reduce arrears |
| **Insurance Pots** | Insurance companies | Premium pools reward loyalty |
| **Remittance Pots** | Money transfer services | Savings incentives for diaspora |
| **Subscription Pots** | SaaS/streaming platforms | Retention rewards reduce churn |
| **DAO Pots** | DAOs and communities | Self-sustaining treasury mechanisms |
| **Charity Pots** | Verified nonprofits | Donations compound, impact multiplies |

**Each pot is deployed WITH a partner, not against them.**

---

## The Math at Scale

| Year | Lettery TVL | New Pots | Combined TVL | Annual Overflow |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 5 | $50M | 0 | $50M | $0 |
| 10 | $100M | 2 | $150M | $5M |
| 15 | $200M | 5 | $500M | $20M |
| 20 | $300M | 10 | $2B | $100M |
| 30 | $500M | 25 | $10B | $500M |
| 40 | $750M | 50 | $50B | $2B |
| 50 | $1B | 100+ | $500B | $20B |
| 75 | $1B | 500+ | $5T | $200B |

*These are illustrative projections, not guarantees. Actual growth depends on adoption, partnerships, and execution.*

**Within a human lifetime, this could manage more capital than most sovereign wealth funds.**

## The Vision

```
Lettery (proof of concept)
        │
        ▼
Cap hit. Overflow begins.
        │
        ▼
Partner discussions with FIs and regulators
        │
        ▼
First institutional pots (sandbox/licensed)
        │
        ▼
Government engagement and pilots
        │
        ▼
Each pot generates its own overflow
        │
        ▼
Overflow feeds back to expansion
        │
        ▼
Global savings infrastructure
        │
        ▼
The Eternal Seed becomes THE primitive
```

Lettery proves it works.

Partners provide distribution.

Regulators provide clarity.

**Together, we build savings infrastructure.**

## Essential Infrastructure and Security

### Chainlink: The Oracle Backbone

DYBL requires reliable, decentralised infrastructure. Chainlink provides:

| Component | Chainlink Service | Why Essential |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Randomness** | VRF (Verifiable Random Function) | Provably fair weekly draws |
| **Automation** | Chainlink Automation | Trustless treasury management (V2) |
| **Price Feeds** | Data Feeds | Multi-asset expansion (future) |
| **Cross-Chain** | CCIP | Multi-chain pot deployment (future) |

**Every pot needs Chainlink. Chainlink is infrastructure.**

---

### Cyfrin: The Security Standard

Every pot must be secure. No exceptions. Cyfrin provides:

| Need | Cyfrin Service | Why Essential |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Code Audit** | Professional security review | Catch vulnerabilities before deployment |
| **Standards** | Security best practices | Every new pot meets same standard |
| **Ongoing** | Monitoring and updates | Continuous security posture |
| **Education** | Developer training | Build security culture |

**A pot without audit is a pot we don't deploy. Cyfrin sets the bar.**

---

### Aave: The Yield Engine

DYBL doesn't just use Aave. We help Aave.

#### The Problem for Aave

| Issue | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| Low yield | Users leave for better rates |
| Market crash | Panic withdrawals, liquidity crunch |
| Bear market | Deposits dry up |
| Competition | Users chase highest APY |

#### How DYBL Helps Aave

| DYBL Feature | Aave Benefit |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Locked deposits** | Sticky TVL that doesn't flee |
| **Streak incentives** | Users stay to keep streak |
| **Weekly deposits** | Consistent inflow regardless of market |
| **Counter-cyclical** | When yield chasers leave, DYBL users stay |
| **Web2 onboarding** | Mainstream users access Aave without knowing |

#### Counter-Cyclical Liquidity Injection

When Aave yield drops and users leave:

```
Aave yield drops
        │
        ▼
Yield chasers leave Aave
        │
        ▼
Liquidity decreases
        │
        ▼
DYBL overflow injects into Aave
        │
        ▼
Liquidity stabilises
        │
        ▼
Aave can maintain rates
        │
        ▼
DYBL earns yield on injection
        │
        ▼
Yield feeds back to overflow
        │
        ▼
Cycle continues
```

**We're not yield chasers. We're yield stabilisers.**

When everyone runs, we inject.

#### The Liquidity Layer (At Scale)

| Scale | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **$50M** | One protocol depositor |
| **$500M** | Significant Aave liquidity provider |
| **$5B** | Counter-cyclical stabiliser |
| **$50B** | Systemic liquidity layer |
| **$500B+** | DeFi's liquidity backbone |

**DYBL becomes programmatic liquidity for DeFi.**

---

### Truflation: The Growth Governor

As DYBL scales, it doesn't just READ inflation. It could CAUSE inflation pressure.

#### The Problem at Scale

| DYBL Scale | Potential Impact |
|------------|------------------|
| $100M | Negligible market impact |
| $10B | Noticeable liquidity flows |
| $100B | Could affect regional markets |
| $1T+ | Systemic impact on savings/inflation |

**Uncontrolled expansion at scale is irresponsible.**

#### How Truflation Governs Growth

| Economic Condition | Truflation Signal | DYBL Response |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| High inflation | Inflation rate elevated | Slow expansion, reduce new pots |
| Low inflation | Inflation rate stable | Normal expansion pace |
| Economic stress | Composite indicators stressed | Counter-cyclical injection |
| Regional variation | Geography-specific data | Calibrate regional expansion |

#### Truflation's Role

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Expansion Governor** | Calibrate how fast overflow deploys |
| **Regional Calibration** | Different rates for different economies |
| **Counter-Cyclical Trigger** | Signal when to inject vs. hold |
| **Guardian Decision Support** | Real-time economic context for votes |

#### Why This Matters

Traditional finance has central banks governing money supply.

DYBL at scale needs equivalent governance - but trustless, data-driven, transparent.

**Truflation becomes our "central bank data layer."**

Not just a data feed. Infrastructure for responsible scaling.

## Who Decides Expansion?

At $50M TVL, a small team can make decisions.

At $500B TVL, those decisions affect global markets.

**Trillion-dollar decisions require trillion-dollar minds.**

The Overflow mechanics are immutable. Each pot runs itself forever.

But WHICH pots to create? WHICH partners to approve? HOW MUCH to allocate?

Those decisions require judgment. Those decisions require governance.

**See: [The Overflow: Why the Eternal Seed Needs Guardians](./THE_OVERFLOW_GUARDIANS_v1.md)**

The Guardian paper explains:
- Why human judgment is needed for expansion
- Who should make these decisions
- The proposed Guardian Council structure
- What guardians do (and don't do)

---

## Summary

| Phase | Years | What Happens | TVL Target |
|-------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **1. Early Growth** | 1-5 | Treasury takes %, prove concept | $50M |
| **2. Treasury Sunset** | 5-10 | Treasury stops taking, pot increases | $100M |
| **3. Cap Hit** | 5-10 | Overflow begins, expansion fund grows | — |
| **4. Distribution** | 10+ | Savers / Treasury / Charity | $500M |
| **5. Expansion** | 10-50+ | Partner pots with FIs, govts, institutions | $1T+ |

**Lettery is the seed.**

**Overflow is the expansion.**

**Partnerships are the path.**

**Global infrastructure is the vision.**
