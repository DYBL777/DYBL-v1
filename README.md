# DYBL - Decentralised Yield Bearing Legacy

**"The Eternal Seed"** A Self-Sustaining Compounding Primitive

**Designed for Web2, with Web3 under the hood.**

---

## The Problem

Traditional lotteries reset to zero after every jackpot. Start over. 

Subscription payments drain away, no compounding, no shared upside.

## The Solution

**The Eternal Seed** a percentage of every payment is retained forever.

Under normal operating conditions, the pot floor only rises.

## How The Eternal Seed Works

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. User buys ticket | 10% ($0.30 of $3) goes to Seed |
| 2. Seed stays in pot | NEVER paid out to winners |
| 3. Seed earns yield | Compounded weekly via Aave |
| 4. No jackpot winner? | Rolls over, Seed base grows |
| 5. User breaks streak? | 50% of their yield → pot |

**Result:** Pot floor can only rise (under normal conditions).

*Note: Not immune to smart contract risk, protocol exploits, or stablecoin depegs.*
