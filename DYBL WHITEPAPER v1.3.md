# The Eternal Seed: A Self-Sustaining Compounding Primitive for Recurring Payments

**DYBL Foundation**  
*January 2026*

---

## Abstract

The Eternal Seed is a DeFi primitive that transforms recurring payments into perpetual, yield-generating flows.

Traditional payment systems let money drain away. No compounding. No shared upside. The Eternal Seed fixes this by retaining a percentage of every payment forever, creating a compounding pool that, under normal operating conditions, can only grow.

**Core Innovation:**
- A set percentage of every payment retained forever
- Retained funds compound via DeFi yield (Aave)
- Behavioural incentives reward consistency, penalise inconsistency
- Immutable contract. Treasury can only decrease. No backdoors.
- Overflow mechanism seeds expansion into TradFi, government, and beyond
- Designed for Web2 users. Web3 under the hood.

**Flagship Application:** Lettery. A no-loss lottery where ALL users buy tickets, enter draws, and earn yield. Features a Pavlovian saver/gambler toggle with Personal Rollover (V2) and on-chain inheritance.

**Broader Applications:** Subscriptions, insurance, pensions, SaaS, DAO treasuries. Anywhere recurring payments flow.

**Result:** A retained pool floor that only rises. Today's seed becomes tomorrow's fortune.

*Note: Not immune to smart contract risk, protocol exploits, or stablecoin depegs. See Risk Assessment section.*

## Introduction

### The Problem

**Traditional Lotteries:**
- Jackpot won. 100% paid out. Pot resets to ZERO.
- Start over every time.
- No compounding. No shared upside.

**Traditional Payments and Subscriptions:**
- Money drains away. No compounding. No shared upside.
- Users bear all costs. Platforms capture all value.
- Near-zero interest in savings accounts.

**Existing DeFi Solutions:**
- PoolTogether relies on external yield. Struggles when rates drop.
- Yield farming has high volatility. Unsustainable.
- Complex onboarding excludes mainstream users. Payment abstraction solves this.

### The DYBL Solution

The Eternal Seed changes the paradigm.

1. **Every payment feeds the seed.** A percentage is retained forever.
2. **Seed never leaves.** Winners paid from prize pool. Seed untouched.
3. **Seed earns yield.** Compounded via Aave.
4. **Rollovers grow it.** Unwon jackpots stay in pot.
5. **Forfeits feed it.** Inconsistent users lose yield to the community.
6. **Immutable rules.** Treasury can only decrease. No backdoors.
7. **Overflow expands it.** When metrics hit, overflow seeds new pots globally.

Designed for Web2 users. Web3 under the hood.

No DeFi knowledge required. Just pay, play, and watch the pot grow.

## Why The Seed Changes Everything

### Traditional Lottery

- Jackpot won. Pot equals zero. Start over.
- Players wait months for jackpot to rebuild.
- No floor. No momentum.

**If Traditional Lottery Had a Seed:**
- Jackpot won. Seed stays. Pot rebuilds from higher floor.
- Next jackpot starts bigger.
- Players stay engaged.

### PoolTogether

- Prize equals Aave yield only.
- Low yield means tiny prizes. Users leave.
- No buffer. No floor.

**If PoolTogether Had a Seed:**
- Low yield? Seed still compounds.
- Prizes have a floor regardless of rates.
- Would have survived the bear market.

### DYBL

- Has the seed.
- Has the floor.
- Has the injection mechanism (V2).
- Has the overflow expansion mechanism.
- Built to survive what killed the others.

## The Eternal Seed Mechanism

### How It Works

Every payment flows through this split:

```
$3 Ticket Purchase
│
├── Prize Pot (in Aave)
│   ├── Prize Pool (paid to winners)
│   └── Eternal Seed (NEVER LEAVES)
│
└── Treasury
    ├── Giveaway Reserve (cashback, rewards)
    └── Operations
```

*Note: All percentages are configurable at deployment.*

### Why The Seed Can Only Grow (Under Normal Conditions)

**Growth Sources:**

| Source | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **New tickets** | Every payment adds to seed |
| **Aave yield** | Seed earns proportional yield |
| **Jackpot rollover** | No 6/6 winner? Stays in pot |
| **Tier rollover** | No winners at tier? Stays in pot |
| **Forfeit yield** | Broken streaks. 50% to pot |

**What Happens When Someone Wins:**

- Winner gets paid from the prize pool portion.
- The seed portion is NEVER paid out.
- Seed stays. Pot rebuilds. Floor rises.

**Traditional Lottery:**
Jackpot won. Pot equals zero. Start over.

**Eternal Seed:**
Jackpot won. Seed stays. Floor never drops to zero. Compounding continues.

---

## Immutable Design and Treasury Sunset

### Trustless by Design

The Eternal Seed contract is immutable. No admin can change the core rules after deployment.

**What's locked forever:**
- USDC address
- Aave pool address
- Chainlink VRF coordinator
- Deploy timestamp

**What can ONLY move in one direction:**
- Payout percentage can only INCREASE (better for users)
- Treasury take can only DECREASE (eventually to zero)

No backdoors. No rug pulls. Code is law.

### Treasury Sunset and Overflow Mechanism

Treasury take is configured at deployment and decreases over time. Here's how:

**Phase 1: Early Growth**
- Treasury takes configured slice of each ticket
- Funds operations and giveaway reserves
- Pot grows from remaining allocation

**Phase 2: Cap/Metrics Achieved**
- When configured cap or metrics are hit, treasury STOPS taking from frontend
- 100% of new tickets flow to pot
- Overflow begins

**Phase 3: Overflow Distribution**
- Overflow splits are immutable: Savers, Treasury, Charity
- Overflow is monitored
- As overflow grows, it seeds NEW pots for broader applications

**The Timeline:**

Early phase: Treasury takes configured slice.
Cap/metrics hit: Treasury stops taking from frontend.
Overflow begins: Splits to Savers, Treasury, Charity (immutable).
Forever: Overflow grows, seeds new pots.

This is not a promise. It's coded into the contract. Immutable.

---

*Footnote on Overflow:*

*When cap/metrics are achieved, treasury stops taking from new tickets. Overflow begins. Overflow splits are immutable: Savers, Treasury, Charity.*

*As overflow grows, it seeds new pots for broader applications: TradFi integrations, government programmes, pensions, utilities.*

*Lettery is the proof of concept. Overflow is the expansion mechanism. The Eternal Seed becomes infrastructure.*

---

## V1.3: Fixed Seed Implementation

### Current Architecture

**Revenue Split (Per Ticket):**
- Configured percentage to Prize Pot
  - Prize Pool (to winners)
  - Eternal Seed (retained forever)
- Configured percentage to Treasury
  - Giveaway Reserve
  - Operations

*All percentages configurable at deployment.*

**Yield Allocation:**
- Seed yield credited to Prize Pot (materialised weekly)
- User yield available to users (withdraw or gamble with)
- Treasury yield funds operations

**Key Features:**
- All users buy tickets to participate
- Chainlink VRF for provably fair draws
- Aave V3 for yield generation
- Withdrawal lock period (prevents gaming)
- Mulligan system (one free missed week per year)
- Legacy Mode (on-chain inheritance)
- Immutable core. One-way treasury changes only.

### V1.3 Changelog

- Removed depositSavings(). All users must buy tickets to participate.
- Clarified saver/gambler mechanics (V2 feature).
- Honest risk assessment added.
- Seed yield materialisation implemented.

## V2 Roadmap: Automated Treasury Management

V2 introduces real-time, automated injection and withdrawal between treasury and prize pot.

### The Goal

The Giveaway Reserve is over-funded in early phases. Only a portion gets paid out. Idle capital could work harder for the pot.

V2 Solution: Automated injection from treasury to pot when needed. Withdrawal back when stable.

### Option A: Chainlink Automation Only

| Component | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Monitor** | Chainlink Automation watches pot size |
| **Rules** | Fixed thresholds (configured at deployment) |
| **Execute** | Chainlink Automation calls inject/withdraw function |
| **Frequency** | Constant. Configurable. |

**Pros:**
- Works today
- One integration
- Fully automated and trustless

**Cons:**
- Fixed rules don't adapt to external conditions
- Thresholds set at launch, never change

### Option B: Truflation + Chainlink Automation

| Component | Who Does It |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data** | Truflation (inflation, competitor rates, economic signals) |
| **Logic** | Smart contract (thresholds adjust based on Truflation data) |
| **Execute** | Chainlink Automation (calls function when conditions met) |

**Or (Novel Use Case):**

| Component | Who Does It |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Monitor** | Truflation watches pot health directly (like it watches inflation) |
| **Trigger** | Truflation signals when injection or withdrawal needed |
| **Execute** | Chainlink Automation executes transaction |

**Pros:**
- Smart rules that adapt to real-world conditions
- Thresholds adjust for inflation, competitor rates, economic context
- Novel use case for Truflation. DeFi protocol health monitoring.

**Cons:**
- Two integrations required
- More complex implementation
- New territory for Truflation

### V2 Summary

| Approach | Rules | Adapts? |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Chainlink Automation only** | Fixed thresholds | No |
| **Truflation + Chainlink** | Dynamic thresholds | Yes. Responds to real world. |

V1.3 launches with manual triggers. V2 adds Chainlink Automation for full automation.

## Example Application: Lettery

Lettery is the flagship demonstration of the Eternal Seed. A no-loss lottery where everyone plays, everyone earns, and the pot can only grow.

### How It Works

**User Journey:**
1. Buy a ticket (USDC)
2. Pick 6 unique characters from 42-character meme alphabet
3. Ticket funds flow to Aave (earning yield)
4. Weekly Chainlink VRF draw
5. Winners share prize pool. Seed stays forever.

**The Meme Alphabet (42 Characters):**
```
A-Z (26 letters) + 0-9 (10 digits) + !@#$%& (6 special) = 42 symbols
```

**Prize Tiers (from Prize Pool):**

| Tier | Match | Share of Weekly Payout |
|------|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | 6/6 (Jackpot) | Configured %. Rolls over if no winner. |
| 2 | 5/6 | Configured % |
| 3 | 4/6 | Configured % |
| 4 | 3/6 | Configured % |
| 5 | 2/6 | Configured % |

**Key Rule:** Users win at their BEST tier only. No double-dipping.

### Why Jackpot Size Matters

Most people play lotteries for the big jackpot.

Traditional lottery: Jackpot resets to zero after win. Back to small prizes.

Eternal Seed: Jackpot has a FLOOR. Even after payout, seed ensures minimum pot size. Jackpots start bigger. Grow faster. Attract more players.

Big jackpot means more players. More players means more tickets. More tickets means bigger seed. Bigger seed means even bigger jackpot.

### User Protections

**Withdrawal Lock:**
Prevents hit-and-run yield farming. Encourages genuine participation.

**Mulligan:**
One free missed week per year (after eligibility period). Life happens. We don't punish humans for being human.

**Yield Transparency:**
All yield calculations on-chain. Users see exactly what they've earned.

### Legacy Mode

After eligibility period of consistent play:
- Set an heir (on-chain)
- If inactive for claim period, heir can claim balance plus yield
- Unclaimed after expiry? Funds go to pot and treasury

Generational wealth transfer. Coded into DeFi.

## The Pavlovian Toggle and Personal Rollover (V2)

The saver/gambler toggle is a V2 feature. It appears Week 2 when users have yield to make a choice about.

### The Personal Rollover

This is the core behavioural mechanism.

Every week, consistent players must press a button: their Personal Rollover.

Two choices:
- **SAVE:** Roll my yield into savings (cash at end of year)
- **GAMBLE:** Roll my yield into extra tickets (more chances to win)

The act of pressing conditions behaviour. You're not passively earning. You're actively choosing. Every single week.

This is Pavlov in action. The button becomes habit. The habit becomes saving.

### How It Works

**ALL USERS:**
Pay for ticket. Get ticket. Enter draw. Earn yield.
Everyone plays. Everyone has a chance to win.

**SAVERS (consistent, choose cash rewards):**
- Play full year (perfect streak)
- Press SAVE on Personal Rollover each week
- 100% yield paid as end-of-year cashback (USDC)
- 100% loyalty cashback
- Maximum rewards for maximum consistency

**GAMBLERS (consistent, choose ticket rewards):**
- Play full year (perfect streak)
- Press GAMBLE on Personal Rollover each week
- 100% yield converted to extra tickets through the year
- Reduced loyalty cashback
- More chances to win. Less guaranteed cash.

**INCONSISTENT PLAYERS:**
- Miss weeks. Break streak. Forfeit yield.
- Portion of forfeited yield to Prize Pot
- Portion of forfeited yield to Treasury
- Their loss feeds the Eternal Seed

### Why The Game Favours Savers

By design.

Savers get MORE rewards than gamblers:
- Same yield (100%)
- More cashback (100% versus reduced)

**The psychology:**
1. Gambler thinks: I want more tickets to win big!
2. Gambler sees: Savers getting full cashback plus same yield value
3. Gambler realises: Maybe saving IS better.
4. Gambler becomes: Saver

Over time, gamblers convert to savers. More consistent players. Healthier pot. Better for everyone.

### Why Personal Rollover Matters

It's not just about the reward. It's about the action.

Every week you press that button, you're reinforcing behaviour. You're making a conscious choice about your financial future. Save or gamble. Compound or spend.

Most people, most weeks, will press SAVE. Because seeing that growing balance feels good. Because choosing saving becomes automatic.

That's the Pavlov Toggle. That's the Personal Rollover. That's behavioural finance coded into DeFi.

## Broader Applications

The Eternal Seed works anywhere recurring payments flow.

### Without Prize Element (Pure Yield):

**Subscriptions and SaaS:**
Monthly payments compound collectively. Consistent subscribers earn yield. Reduces churn. Increases retention.

**Insurance Premiums:**
Premiums pool into Eternal Seed vault. Consistent payers earn on unused premiums. Growing reserves cover claims.

**Pensions and Retirement:**
Contributions compound via Eternal Seed. Guaranteed growth floor (under normal conditions). Behavioural incentives for consistent saving.

**DAO Treasuries:**
Membership dues compound collectively. Forfeits fund community initiatives. Self-sustaining governance budgets.

### With Prize Element (Gamified):

**Remittances:**
Send money home plus enter draw. Seed grows from global flows. Makes remittances exciting.

**Utilities:**
Pay bills plus earn yield plus win prizes. Reduces effective costs. Financial inclusion.

### The Common Thread

Every application benefits from:
- Retained capital (seed)
- Compounding yield
- Behavioural incentives
- Growing floor
- Overflow expansion mechanism

The primitive is universal. Lettery is just the proof of concept.

## Risk Assessment

### Honest Evaluation

This is experimental DeFi. The following risks exist:

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Smart contract vulnerability** | High | Professional audit (Cyfrin). Formal verification. |
| **Aave protocol exploit** | High | Monitor Aave security. Emergency procedures. |
| **USDC depeg** | Medium | Diversified stablecoin support (future). |
| **Chainlink VRF failure** | Medium | Timeout resets. Manual fallback. |
| **Low Aave liquidity** | Medium | Liquidity checks. Rescue patterns. |
| **Regulatory uncertainty** | Medium | Legal review. Non-prize versions for restricted regions. |

### What "Pot Can Only Grow" Actually Means

Under normal operating conditions, the pot floor only rises because:
- Seed is never paid out
- Yield compounds
- Rollovers accumulate
- Forfeits feed the pot

This does NOT mean immune to:
- Smart contract bugs
- Protocol exploits
- Stablecoin depegs
- Catastrophic market events

We are honest about risks. No false promises.

## Challenges and Future Work

### Regulatory Clarity

**Challenge:** Prize elements may trigger gambling regulations in some jurisdictions.

**Approach:**
- Pure yield versions (no prize) for restricted regions
- Legal review in target markets
- Transparent disclosures

### UX for Web2 Users

**Challenge:** Wallets, gas fees, USDC onboarding.

**Solutions:**
- Account abstraction (gasless transactions)
- Payment abstraction (fiat in, crypto out, user never knows)
- Fiat on-ramps (Stripe, Circle)
- Mobile-first design
- Feels like Web2. Powered by Web3.

### Optimal Parameters

**Challenge:** What's the ideal seed percentage? Treasury split? Injection thresholds?

**Approach:**
- Start with conservative defaults
- Monitor real-world performance
- Adjust based on data

### Audit and Security

**Status:** V1.3 is audit-ready.

**Plan:**
- Professional audit (Cyfrin or Chainlink ecosystem)
- Formal verification
- Bug bounty program (post-mainnet)

**Timeline:**
- Audit preparation complete
- Professional audit next
- Mainnet launch post-audit only
